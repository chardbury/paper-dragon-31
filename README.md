# Cop Cake Caper

This is our entry in PyWeek 31; the contest entry page is here: https://pyweek.org/e/paper-dragon-31/.


## Game Summary

Patches and Flynn were the bane of the wood;
They got up to all of the mischief they could.
They scrumped from Sam's orchard and littered the cores.
They filched them from poor Mrs Appleby's stores.

But now that the fuzz is on to their stuff;
Patches and Flynn are finding it rough
To steal the apples and all their hijinks.
"We need a decoy", say Patches. Flynn thinks.

Then Flynn says, "Hey! I've got just the plan!"
So Patches and Flynn did set up a stand
In front of the places they're pulling their jobs
So rather than chase them, The Blue stuff their gobs!
