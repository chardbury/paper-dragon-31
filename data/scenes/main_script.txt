Constable Iced Bun: Hello there Flynn. What are you up to today?
Flynn: No need for suspicion. I am just selling distra- umm, copcakes.

Flynn: Yes... copcakes. Very tasty.
Constable Iced Bun: Let me see... Oh, these are just do-
Flynn: Copcakes!
Constable Iced Bun: Well... They look very nice, I'll take three.

Constable Iced Bun: Wait a minute, where's your friend Patches? Shouldn't she be helping you?
Flynn: She's scrump- she went to get supplies, she'll be back soon.
Constable Iced Bun: Supplies for what, you've hardly made anything!
Flynn: ...
Flynn: Please don't tell our parents.

Patches : I did it! I scrumped an apple!
Patches : Mmm, so red and shiny.
Flynn : Wait, what about me? Where's my apple?
Patches : I was supposed to get more than one?
Flynn : Get as many as you can.
Patches : Righto. Make another distraction.

Sgt. Dognut : I don't trust those racoons. This must be a trick.
Constable Iced Bun : I thought so too, but these 'cakes' are rather good.
Sgt. Dognut : Hmm... We'll see about that.

Flynn: Hello Dognut
Dognut: That's Sergeant Dognut to you. Now what's all this about cakes?
Flynn: They're very good cakes. Not distractions at all. Would you like one?
Dognut: Do they come with icing?
dogunut Flynn: For you? Absolutely!

<failure>
Dognut|: I knew it! You have no idea what you are doing.
Flynn: But the icing machine is so complicated.
Dognut: Where's Patches? Is she stealing Granny Smith's apples again?
Flynn: No... she's sick?
Dognut: You tried that one last week.
<endfailure>

<success>
Patches : Total success, victory is ours!
Flynn: You got the apples?
Patches : A scrumptious sackfull indeed.
Flynn : Excellent. But why did you need a distraction cake?
Patches : I wanted to see what they taste like... it was really chewy.
Flynn : Well you did order an uncooked one.
Patches ohno: You can cook them!?
<endsuccess>

Flynn : I'm worried they're starting to catch on. I don't want you to get caught.
Patches : Well, right after you hit them with the old distraction cake they just leave and wander around eating it.
Flynn : Good point. We need a way to keep them hanging around the wagon.
Patches : I know! Plates! If we give them plates they'll have to stick around to give the plates back.

Constable Iced Bun: Patches! I see you climbing over the garden fence!
Sgt Dognut : Flynn, where's my order?
Patches: They saw me!
Flynn: They caught on!
Flynn & Patches : Abandon the wagon!
<endfailure>

<success>
Sgt. Dognut : I bet Comissioner Peanut would really like these.
Sgt. Dognut : It's a pity she's at the police picnic at Vermillion Orchard.
<endsuccess>

Patches: So why are we at the Vermillion Orchard?
Flynn : The cops in the village are all full. They've stopped buying our distraction.
Patches : Well at least there are lots of apples here. 
Patches ohno : But why are there so many cops?
Flynn : Focus on scrumping and I'll shower them with sprinkles.
Patches: Both colours!? Let's do this!

Constable Peanut: Ho ho ho. I've caught you, you naughty scrumpers
Constable Peanut: The punishment for disrupting our picnic is...
Constable Peanut: LITTER PICKING.
Patches: Oh no.
Constable Peanut: And I'm telling your parents.
Flynn: Oh no.
Constable Peanut: And I'm confiscating those apples.
Both: Oh no!
<endfailure>

<success>
Patches : There are so many apple trees here. It seems like the apples never end (reword?)
Flynn : Patches no, we need to stop.
Patches : But why. Did someone spot me?
Patches : Did the cops get suspicious?
Patches : Did the bin catch fire... again?
Flynn : Better! The wagon is so full of apples there's no more room.
