Sgt. Dognut : Are the racoons up to mischief? What do you have there?
Constable Iced Bun : These are very good doughnuts.
Sgt. Dognut : If they are selling doughnuts then they can't be scrumping.
<scene change>
Sgt. Dognut : Do you have doughnuts with icing?
Flynn (showing doughnut) : Why yes

<level 2>

<failure>
Sgt. Dognut: Cook the doughnut, put icing on it, hand it to me.
Sgt. Dognut: It isn't difficult. Are you distracted?
Sgt. Dognut: Where's Patches? Is she stealing Granny Smith's apples again?
Flynn: No...

Flynn : What were you doing, you were supposed to be scrumping me an apple?
Patches : I wanted to see what the doughnuts tasted like.
Patches : Here, a nice crunchy Braeburn.

Flynn : That was close. We need a way to keep them at the stall longer.
Patches : I know! Plates! If we give them plates they'll have to stick around to eat them.
